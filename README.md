# Predicting House Prices in Bangalore

Welcome to the House Price Prediction project for Bangalore! In this project, we explore the step-by-step process of building and predicting house prices in Bangalore using various data science techniques and machine learning algorithms.

## Overview

We start by building a predictive model using scikit-learn and linear regression. Our dataset is sourced from Kaggle, specifically the "Bangalore Home Prices" dataset. Throughout the project, we cover a wide range of concepts, including data loading and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

## Algorithms and Accuracy

To find the most accurate prediction model, we employ multiple regression algorithms, including:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Ridge Regression**
- **Lasso Regression**

After extensive testing, we achieved the best accuracy of 80.2% with the Linear Regression algorithm.

## Tools and Technologies

Here's a list of the tools and technologies used in this project:

- **Python**: The primary programming language for data analysis and model building.
- **Numpy and Pandas**: Utilized for efficient data cleaning and manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for creating informative data visualizations.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Our go-to library for machine learning model development.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: The interactive environment where we conducted our analysis.
- **Kaggle Dataset**: We used the [Bangalore House Price Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data) from Kaggle as our primary data source.
