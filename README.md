This project walks through step by step process of how to build and predict the house prices in Bangalore. i first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle. During model building I covered almost all concepts such as data loading and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering etc. Also, used algorithms like Linear Regression, Ridge Regression , Lasso Regression to check best accuracy. Out of these three algorithms we received best accuracy of 80.2% for Linear Regression.
Below are the tools and technolgies used:
1.	Python
2.	Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3.	Matplotlib for data visualization
4.	Sklearn for model building
5.	Jupyter notebook
